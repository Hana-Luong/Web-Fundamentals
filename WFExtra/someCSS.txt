Some reminders:

If you haven’t yet, please shoot me a screenshot of your best work.
Some of you are creating multiple classes for things which have the same styling; instead use one class and apply it to multiple elements.
In the stylesheet, p targets all paragraph elements, .wrap targets all elements with a class of wrap, and #very-specific targets the element with an ID of very-specific. For most use cases,
I’d stick with elements or classes in terms of the styling.
