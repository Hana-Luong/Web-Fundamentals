<!-- Use Proper Document Structure
Pages will render without the use of the <!DOCTYPE html> doctype or <html>, <head>, 
and <body> elements. However, without the doctype and these structural elements,
pages will not render properly in every browser. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title> My First Website </title>
    </head> 
    <body>
        <h1> Hello World! </h1>
        <p> This is my first website </p>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- Constantly Validate Your Code! While writing HTML, make a habit to validate 
frequently, such as W3C Markup Validation Service  -->

<!-- Organize HTML Syntax
As your HTML gets bigger, managing it can become quite a task. Below are quick rules
that can help you keep your syntax clean and organized:
- Use lowercase letters within element names, attributes, and values.
- Indent nested elements. 
- Use double quotes, not single or completely omitted quotes to store in values for HTML 
attributes. -->
<h1 id="page_title">My First Website!</h1>
<p class="sub_title">This is <span class="emphasize">Cool!</span></p>

<!-- Avoid Using Too Many divs! -->

<!-- Make Use of Semantic Elements
Deciding which elements to use to describe different content may be difficult, but these 
elements are the backbone of semantics. Note: Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to 
reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages rather than merely to define its presentation or look.

<!-- Keep Your Tag Names Lowercase -->

<!-- Use alt Attribute With Images -->
