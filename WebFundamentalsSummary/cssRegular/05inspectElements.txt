Editing HTML and CSS can feel like disarming a bomb; one little change and your project 
goes bananas. Your greatest ally in editing is a browser tool called Developer Tools. 
It is included in Chrome, Firefox, the latest version of Internet Explorer, Edge, and 
Safari.

To access inspect element, simply right-click any element within the browser window and
click 'Inspect' and voila! Inspect Element is a feature that displays all of the 
properties of the webpage you are currently viewing.

Color Picker
Color palette selection and design are important parts of designing a web page. To help 
with precise color selection, there are a variety of tools available to both find/define 
colors and assemble color palettes. Tools for generating color schemes are easily found 
searching the internet, but getting the exact color used on your favorite website's button 
borders might seem more difficult. In this section, we will outline how to use the Chrome 
ool's Color picker to help us find colors from other websites that we may be after!

To access the colorpicker tool, we need to first open the Chrome Dev tools and select an
element with a background color. Once we have the dev tools opened and an element with 
a background color selected we can click on the color patch in the Style window of the 
Dev tools. At this point, the dev tools will display a variety of color information about
the background color of the element- showing different adjustable slides, color code 
values, related colors, and a gradient of different intensities and darkness.

To use the color picker to find the values of colors on the page, click the eye dropper
icon to toggle color-picker to ON (should turn blue). At this point, you can move your 
mouse cursor over the webpage and a small circle showing the magnified pixels near your 
cursor will be displayed, with the central pixel outlined and its' color value displayed
on click.
