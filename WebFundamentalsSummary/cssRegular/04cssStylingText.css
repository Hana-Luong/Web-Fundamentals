/* color:
The text color is specified using the color property. 
The value of the color property can be expressed using hex, RGB or semantic code. */
  p {
    color: #ffffff;
  }
  a {
    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);

  span {
    color: white;

/* text-align:
This property is used to set the horizontal alignment of any text. 
Text can be centered, or aligned to the left or right, or justified. 
This property will only work if the property is also display block. */

The text-decoration property is used to add and remove underlines, overlines, 
and line-throughs. */

/* Font
font-family:
The font-family property specifies the font style to use for an element. 
There are two types of font family names:

named-family - Examples "times", "courier", "arial"
generic-family - Examples "serif", "sans-serif", "cursive", "fantasy", "monospace" */

/* Web-safe fonts:
Some of these are; Verdana, Arial, Trebuchet MS, Times New Roman, Georgia, Andale Mono, 
Courier New, Comic Sans, and Impact. */
  p {
    font-family: "helvetica neue", arial, verdana, sans-serif;
  }

/* Font-family allows for multiple options to be entered where the browser goes through 
them from left to right until it finds a font that is installed on the system which can
be used. This means that you always want to make sure you have a generic-family option as
your last value so that if none of the others can be found, the browser will use the 
system default for the family specified. */

/* The browser searches for Helvetica Neue on the user's system and uses this if it finds
it.
If Helvetica Neue isn't found, the browser searches for Arial on the user's system and uses 
it if it finds it.
If Arial isn't found, we'll use Verdana.
As a last resort, if none of the fonts in the font stack are found we fall back to 
sans-serif, which basically instructs the browser to use whatever the system's default 
sans-serif font is. You don't know exactly what will be used in this eventuality, but 
at least this is better than ending up with the browser default, Times new roman, which 
is a serif font!
Note that fonts with more than one word in their name need surrounding in quotes. */

/* font-size:
The font-size property values can be expressed in four different units pt, px, em, %. pt 
and px (point and pixel) are considered static sizing and will not adjust properly when 
resizing your page. em and % (responsive measure and percent) however will resize and 
are what most developers recommend using. */

    font-size: 14px;

    font-size: 1.2em;
  }
  span {
    font-size: 80%;
  }

/* dropdown.docx is a drop-down chart showing the approximate equivalents between 
the four units. */


/* font-style
This property controls the slanted emphasis of the text. Some text may have an italic
property built into the font and so selecting italic would be fine. For fonts that do 
not have an italic style, the value oblique can be used to mimic italicized text. */
span {
    font-style: italic;
  }

/* font-weight
This property defines the thickness of a character line. normal is often the default 
value. The values can be set numerically or semantically. */
/* normal, bold, bolder, lighter, 100, ...., 800 */
  p {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  span {
    font-weight: 600;
  }

/* What is a span tag?
If you wanted to highlight specific text within a paragraph or division,
<span> can be used.  Unlike <div> which puts the next <div> on a separate line, 
<span> by default puts the element on the same line.  For example, consider:  */
/* <h1>Hello <div>World</div> </h1> */

/* Above by default would put 'World' on a new line.  However if you wanted World to 
show up in the same line, you could instead do:  */
/* <h1>Hello <span>World</span> </h1> */

/* Then in the css, you could have done something like this to just highlight the 
word 'World': */
h1 span {
   font-weight: bold;
   color: blue;
}
